        <h5 strong>CLAUDETTE COLVIN</h5>has a story of resistance that not enough people know. A pioneer of the African American Civil Rights Movement, she was the first person arrested for resisting bus segregation in Montgomery, Alabama.<br><br> Colvin was among the five plaintiffs
        originally included in the federal court case, filed by civil rights attorney Fred Gray on February 1, 1956, as <em>Browder v. Gayle</em>, and testified before the three-judge panel that heard the case in the United States District Court. On June
        13, 1956, the judges determined that the state and local laws requiring bus segregation in Alabama were unconstitutional.<br><br> The case went to the United States Supreme Court, which upheld the ruling on December 17, 1956. Colvin was the last
        witness to testify. Three days later the Supreme Court issued an order to Montgomery and the state of Alabama to end bus segregation, and the Montgomery Bus Boycott was called off.<br><br> For a long time, Montgomery's black leaders did not publicize
        Colvin's pioneering effort because she was a teenager who was pregnant by a married man; words like "feisty", "mouthy", and "emotional" were used to describe Colvin while her counterpart Parks was seen as calm, well-mannered, and studious. Given
        the social norms of the time and her youth, the NAACP leaders worried about using her to represent their boycott.

        <h5 strong>TIMELINE of American Civil Rights Movement and Claudette’s Life</h5></div><br>
      <div>
        <strong>November 23, 1906:</strong> Montgomery became the first U.S city to segregate public transportation.
      </div><br>
      <div> <strong>May 31, 1909:</strong> The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) is formed.
      </div><br>
      <div> <strong>
         September 5, 1939:</strong> Claudette Colvin is bornin King Hill, Montgomery, Alabama as the daughter of C. P. Colvin and Mary Anne Colvin. Her neighborhood was a very impoverished one where even routine life was a struggle for most.<br><br>        She was a bright girl, intelligent and curious. Her rebellious nature was apparent from a young age. She studied at the Booker T. Washington High School in the city. In spite of her impoverished background, she held high aspirations and had mentioned
        in a school assignment that she wanted to be the president. She learned about the civil rights movement in school and was a member of the NAACP Youth Council.</div>
      <br>
      <div><strong>
1952: </strong>A man named Brooks refused to re-board a bus from the back and asked for his money back. When the police arrived, he was shot and killed.</div><br>
      <div><strong>
      May 17, 1954:</strong> The monumental Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka outlaws racial segregation in schools.</div><br>
      <div><strong>

November, 1954: </strong>While Claudette was in school, a very disturbing incident happened that would remain with her for the rest of her life. A black teenage boy, Jeremiah Reeves was caught having sex with a white woman. On being discovered, the woman
        alleged rape, while Jeremiah insisted it was consensual.<br><br> However, the voice of black individuals was not given any significance during those days, and the boy was arrested, charged for being a serial rapist, and sentenced to die by electric chair.
        He was executed four years later. This incident made Claudette realize how vulnerable the black community was in her city.</div><br>
      <div><strong>
March 2, 1955: </strong>Claudette was riding a Capital Heights bus downtown when some white people got on. She was sitting in the middle and was asked to vacate her seat for a white person who was standing. Even though just 15 years old at that time,
        Claudette knew that it was her right to sit anywhere in the bus as she had bought a ticket. Thus she refused to move, infuriating the bus driver, Robert W. Cleere.<br><br> According to the Jim Crow laws, the driver had the right to call the police
        to make the girl move. Two police officers, Thomas J. Ward and Paul Headley, were called to make Claudette move. When she refused, she was physically assaulted and forcibly taken off of the bus.
        <br>
        <br>
        <h4 class="text-uppercase text-center"><kbd><em><strong>
          I felt like Sojourner Truth was pushing down on one shoulder and <br>&nbspHarriet Tubman was pushing on the other - saying, 'Sit down girl!'
          </strong></em></kbd></h4>

        <br><br> Claudette was taken into police custody. She was terrified — what would the police do to her now? After all, she was just a young girl! She was enraged by the atrocities meted out to her simply for refusing to give in to an act of discrimination.
        She spent three hours in the jail before her mother and pastor, Reverend H.H. Johnson came to bail her out.</div><br>
      <div><strong>
March 18, 1955: </strong>Claudette is found guilty of violating segregation law, disturbing the peace, and assaulting two police officers. However, the incident sparked a heated debate in the Alabama community about the segregation laws.<br><br> The black
        community had started to hail her as a pioneer in African-American civil rights movement when she discovered that she was pregnant. The conservative community felt that hailing an unmarried pregnant woman as an icon would not be ideal. So although
        she was the first ever black person to protest against the segregation of bus seats in Alabama, the recognition went to Rosa Parks, a middle-aged woman.<br><br> Claudette gave birth to a baby boy named Raymond in December 1955.</div><br>
      <div><strong>
December 1, 1955:</strong> Rosa Parks refuses to give her seat on a bus.
      </div><br>
      <div><strong>
December 2, 1955:</strong> The Montgomery Bus Boycott begins, prompting car pools led by the Montgomery Improvement Association.</div>

         This is my Constitutional right!
          </strong></em></kbd></h4><br>
      <div><strong>
      November 13, 1956:</strong> In the <em>Browder v. Gayle</em> court case, Claudette is called as one of the plaintiffs. The court ultimately determined that the bus segregation in Montgomery, Alabama was unconstitutional. The case went to the United
        States Supreme Court who affirmed the District Court’s ruling and Alabama was ordered to end bus segregation on 20 December, 1956.</div>
      <br>
      <div><strong>
December 21, 1956:</strong> First day of integrated bus service in Montgomery.
      </div><br>
      <div><strong>
January 10, 1957:</strong> Black churches are bombed in Montgomery in response to the recent court ruling.</div><br>
      <div><strong>
1958:</strong> Claudette was having problems finding work in her hometown after she became a sort of public figure. She went to New York in 1958 where she first lived with her elder sister. She soon found work as a nurse’s aide in a nursing home in Manhattan.
        <br><br> She had another baby boy while living in New York. She did not marry.</div><br>
      <div><strong>2004: </strong> Claudette retires after working at the same nursing home for 35 years.</div> <br> <h4 class="text-uppercase text-center"><kbd><em><strong>
I knew then and I know now that, when it comes to justice, there is no easy way<br> &nbspto get it. You can't sugarcoat it. You have to take a stand and say,<br> 'This is not right.'
